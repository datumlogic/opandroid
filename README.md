Thank you for downloading Hookflash's Open Peer Android SDK.

For a quick introduction to the code please read the following. For more detailed instructions please go to http://docs.hookflash.com.

From your terminal, please clone the “opandroid” git repository:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/openpeer/opandroid.git

Note the `--recursive` option is key to make sure you get all the necessary libraries

This repository will yield the Android Java SDK, Native sample application and dependency libraries like the C++ Open Peer core, stack, media and libraries needed to support the underlying SDK.

## Directory structure:
+ `opandroid/` - contains the project files for building the Open Peer Android SDK
+ `opandroid/openpeer-android-sdk/` - contains the Open Peer Android Java project files and source folders
+ `opandroid/openpeer-android-sdk/jni/` - contains the Java SDK JNI wires
+ `opandroid/OpenPeerSampleApp/` - contains the sample application 
+ `opandroid/libs` - Contains the core C++ library

##How to build:

###Prerequisites:
+ [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
+ Android NDK  Android NDK r8e (http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r10c-darwin-x86_64.bin for mac) is required. Path to the NDK is mandatory for building 3rd party libraries. 
+ [ninja](http://martine.github.io/ninja/) build sysytem required for WebRTC library build. You can install ninja using MacPorts or Homebrew.


###Build the core C++ library:
You can build the core C++ library yourself but it's recommended you download the prebuilt library since building the C++ library takes long time (between 40minutes and 80mins depending on your network and hardware). Download [latest library here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.hookflash.me/github.com-openpeer-opandroid/opcore.zip)

If you want build the core library yourself, go to the root of repository, run:

`./buildall_android.sh {PATH_TO_NDK}`

This will take a long time but should only need to be done whenever there's change in the `libs/op` repository. Use `buildall_android.sh` to build the C++ libraries first. The libraries' binary files are placed in `libs/op/libs/build` and `libs/op/libs/ortc-lib/libs/build/` and are linked into library project.


###Using Android Studio:
If you use Android Studio, you can simply import from settings.gradle located at root. We're not using the default project structure since we want to be able to support eclipse users as well, but you can configure your project your way.


###Using Eclipse:

1) From Eclipse ADT, import the SDK project:

    opandroid/openpeer—android-sdk (Android Java SDK project)

Then import the sample project:

    opandroid/OpenPeerSampleApp

2) Go to OpenPeerSampleApp and run `./setup-library-proj.sh`, this will set up the required project configurations.

3) Build the imported project using Eclipse with ADT plugin. Follow the instruction to setup [butterknife for eclipse](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/ide-eclipse.html)

During development we use symbolic links to link the SDK source folder from sample app so we can invoke native application debugging in Eclipse. You should not need to debug native libaries but in case you do, executing `setup-native-debug-proj.sh` will set up all symbolic links so you can do native debugging. Executing `setup-library-proj.sh` will clean all the links and use the SDK as library. You can also use gdb command line debugging that way you don't need this script.


###Build with ant(ant 1.8 or newer is required):
We have a simple script `buillall.sh` at root. The script will simply invoke the `buildall_android.sh`, then invoke `ant` to build the sample app. To use this script, you will need to export `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`

    export ANDROID_HOME={PATH-TO-YOUR-ANDROID-SDK}
    export ANDROID_NDK_HOME={PATH-TO-YOUR-ANDROID-NDK}
    ./buildall.sh

For convenience you can put these settings in your `.bash_profile` (assuming you're using Mac OS or Linux).


##Exploring the dependency libraries:
+ `libs/op/libs/ortc-lib/libs/zsLib` - asynchronous communication library for C++
+ `libs/op/libs/ortc-lib/libs/udns` - C language DNS resolution library
+ `libs/op/libs/ortc-lib/libs/cryptopp` – C++ cryptography language
+ `libs/op/libs/ortc-lib/libs/openssl` - C++ Hookflash Open Peer communication services layer
+ `libs/op/libs/ortc-lib/libs/op-services-cpp` - C++ Hookflash Open Peer communication services layer
+ `libs/op/libs/op-stack-cpp` – C++ Hookflash Open Peer stack
+ `libs/op/libs/op-core-cpp` – C++ Hookflash Open Peer core API (works on the Open Peer stack)
+ `libs/op/libs/ortc-lib/libs/WebRTC` – Android port of the WebRTC media stack
